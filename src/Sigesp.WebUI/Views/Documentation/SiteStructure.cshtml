<h3>Site Structure</h3>
<p>The Sigesp Theme at its core is created using Bootstrap 4 components that create several &quot;sections&quot; of content that divide the webpages into logical content partitions. Throughout these <strong>sections</strong> various pieces of content and scripts are loaded to provide a rich, immerse and responsive experience. The focus here lies on presenting readable content using an intuitive structure that caters to the exact need of the Sigesp platform as a whole.</p>
<h3>Sections</h3>
<p>To fully illustrate this concept, please take a look at the following image:</p>
<p><img class="w-75" src="~/img/site-layout.png" alt="Site Structure"></p>
<p>In the above image the following sections are highlighted:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<p>The Sigesp solution is divided into several projects and solution folders. Each project has its own set of responsibilities and determines its tie-in with other projects. The structure as a whole delivers a smooth coding experience whether you have been coding in Visual Studio for a long time, or when you are in the processing of mastering it.</p>
<p>The code, and certainly that which is part of the public API, have been provided with well written comments explaining why the code exists, what its goal is, and how it should be used and which conditions could cause it to fail. This principle and approach is also reflected in the naming of classes, methods and their properties to be as descriptive as possible to help deliver an intuitive coding experience and hopefully to invite <strong>you</strong> to start writing your own!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above listing is based on the <strong>Full</strong> flavor of the Theme, some flavors may not include all listed folders in your solution.</p>
</blockquote>
</div></div></div><div class="panel"><div class="panel-hdr"><h2 id="Navigation">Navigation</h2></div><div class="panel-container show"><div class="panel-content">
<p>The menu in rendered using the <code>nav.json</code> file from the root of the <strong>Sigesp.WebUI</strong> project. Although this could be replaced by using a different data source, we have chosen to use the file provided by the HTML Flavor of Sigesp. This ensures that with every update of the Theme the Menu changes accordingly.</p>
<p>The classes that are used by Sigesp and the model that is consumed by the ViewComponent have been constructed as such that it should be relatively easy to replace it with a database generated collection of menu items instead.</p>
<h3>ViewComponent</h3>
<p>The contents of the Menu is rendered using a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components">ViewComponent</a>. This ensures us that we can use a stand-alone data source that does not have to be fed through Controllers or other means.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp mb-2 mt-0">public class NavigationViewComponent : ViewComponent
{
    public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
    {
        var items = NavigationModel.Full;

        return View(items);
    }
}
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>NavigationModel.Full</code> can be replaced with <code>NavigationModel.Seed</code> to generate the <strong>Seed</strong> flavor menu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The markup for the ViewComponent is located in: <code>/Views/Shared/Components/Navigation/Default.cshtml</code>.</p>
<h4>Authorization</h4>
<p>The <code>nav.json</code> file supports Authorization by specifying a <code>roles</code> array inside the structure. By default the MVC Flavor has been prepared to assign the <strong>Administrator</strong> role to the default user, as such that when Authorization is enabled on rendering the Navigation, certain elements from <code>nav.json</code> will not be rendered unless the same role is specified.</p>
<p>You can enable Authorization inside the ViewComponent <code>Default.cshtml</code> content by looking for this line:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp mb-2 mt-0">@@foreach (var group in Model.Lists)
</pre>
<p>And replacing it by the following line:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp mb-2 mt-0">@@foreach (var group in Model.Lists.AuthorizeFor(User))
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We also have an <strong>interactive</strong> instruction on enabling Authorization for the menu. Please open the <strong>Solution Overview</strong> element of the Menu and click on <strong>Interactive</strong> to find it.</p>
