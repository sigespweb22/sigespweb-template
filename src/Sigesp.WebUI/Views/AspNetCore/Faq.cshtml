                                        This is most likely because there is no localhost certificate available on your computer or the one installed has not been marked trusted yet.

                                        Typically most websites will have <strong>StaticFiles</strong> enabled and this would allow the files to be downloaded.
                                        All files that should be accesible by your visitors is served from the <strong>wwwroot</strong> directory; the navigation sources do not qualify for this as the file is assumed to be of temporary nature.
                                        Furthermore it exists mainly for demo purposes as the assumption is made that you would most likely add the ability to generate a dynamic menu from other data sources, such as a database.

                                            First and foremost, this project is not meant to serve as a <strong>1-in-all</strong> solution for your project start to finish.
                                            It was built and structured in such a way that it can be used as a starting point based on the set of features that speak the most to your intent and purpose (Please see the <a asp-controller="AspNetCore" asp-action="Editions">Editions</a> page to help you decide).
                                        </p>

                                            While we certainly understand your frustration when a specific feature you were looking forward to is not included, we also assume you yourself are perfectly capable of expanding the features of your project over time.
                                            <br/>
                                            If and when a new update happens to include the feature you were (patiently) waiting for, great!
                                            <br/>
                                            Still not added to the project? What?! Don't worry :-) Feel free to let us know on the <a href="https://support.gotbootstrap.com/t/asp-net-core" target="_blank">Supports Forum</a> so we track the interest and see about getting it added in the next version of the template.
